# **Kaggle Notebooks Repository**

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to hosting Jupyter Notebooks created using datasets from Kaggle. This repository serves as a collection of data explorations, analyses, and machine learning projects to showcase my learning and insights.

## **üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

‚Ä¢ [Datasets](my-kaggle-notebooks/datasets/) : Contains links or details about the Kaggle datasets used in the notebooks.  
‚Ä¢ [Notebooks](my-kaggle-notebooks/notebooks/) : Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.  
‚Ä¢ [Resources](my-kaggle-notebooks/resources/) : Supporting files, if any, such as images, data preprocessing scripts, or reference documents.  

## **üìå Notebooks Included**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Insights and visualizations from raw datasets.

2. **Machine Learning Models**
Implementations of various algorithms for prediction, classification, or clustering using libraries like Scikit-learn.

3. **Deep Learning Experiments**
Hands-on experiments with neural networks and deep learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Techniques for text processing, sentiment analysis, and model training on textual data using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face.

# **üöÄ How to Use**

1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshayboffic/my-kaggle-notebooks.git
```

2. Navigate to the notebooks folder and open any ```.ipynb``` file with Jupyte Notebook or Jupyterlab:
```bash
cd my-kaggle-notebooks/notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
